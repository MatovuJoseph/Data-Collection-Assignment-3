\section{METHODOLOGY}

This ODK Build provides an Extensible Mark-up Language (xml) form format which is uploaded to the Aggregate Server that receives the research data sent using the ODK Collect application on the mobile device. The ODK Collect Application is able to do this through uploading the created xml form into it and connecting the ODK Aggregate Server to the ODK Collect using the Aggregate server url. The Aggregate server store all the informing being collected and sent to it.
